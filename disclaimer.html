                        This comprehensive disclaimer establishes the technical and legal framework governing the use of
                        Supplement Spotlight. It clarifies the scope, limitations, and responsibilities related to the
                        information presented on this website. Our goal is to ensure transparency, manage user expectations,
                        and minimize potential liability by detailing the disclaimers pertaining to medical advice,

                    <h3>2.1. Educational Nature of Content</h3>
                    <p>
                        All content on Supplement Spotlight is provided solely for educational and informational purposes.
                        We do not offer personalized medical diagnosis or treatment. Nutritional and supplement information
                        can vary widely based on individual health status, existing medical conditions, medications,
                        allergies, age, sex, and other factors. Users are responsible for verifying any information with
                        qualified healthcare professionals.
                    </p>
                    <h3>2.2. Regulatory Framework & Standards</h3>
                    <p>
                        We reference regulations and guidelines from recognized authorities such as the U.S. Food and Drug
                        Administration (FDA), European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and other relevant bodies. However,
                        regulatory landscapes may differ by country or region. Users should confirm local regulations
                        before acting on any information. We do not guarantee compliance of any product with local laws.
                    </p>
                    <h3>2.3. Limitations and No Warranty</h3>
                    <p>
                        While we apply rigorous processes—literature review, cross-referencing peer-reviewed studies,
                        and critically appraising manufacturer data—errors or omissions may occur. We disclaim any
                        warranty, express or implied, regarding the efficacy, safety, or suitability of any supplement.
                        Use of any supplement discussed here is at the user’s own risk.

                    <h3>3.1. Nature of Affiliate Relationships</h3>
                    <p>
                        Supplement Spotlight participates in affiliate marketing programs, earning commissions when users
                        purchase products via our affiliate links. This revenue supports site maintenance, research, and
                        content production. Affiliate partnerships do not influence editorial integrity: we maintain an
                        objective stance, conducting independent evaluation before linking to any product.
                    </p>
                    <h3>3.2. Commission and Pricing Transparency</h3>
                    <p>
                        Clicking on an affiliate link incurs no additional cost to the user. Prices and availability on
                        retailer sites may change without notice; we are not responsible for price discrepancies or
                        stock issues. We strive to indicate when content includes affiliate links and to disclose any
                        potential conflicts of interest.
                    </p>

                        <li>
                            Affiliate links are implemented via tracking parameters (e.g., URL query strings, cookies).
                            We adhere to privacy standards by not storing personally identifiable information solely
                            for affiliate tracking beyond what is typical for affiliate programs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Links may redirect through affiliate networks; ensure that you review the final destination
                            before completing a purchase.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We do not guarantee continuous affiliate partnerships; links may be updated or removed if

                        to monitor site performance, user behavior trends, and to optimize user experience. We do not

                        <summary><strong>Q1: Is the information on supplements a substitute for medical advice?</strong></summary>
                        <p>
                            No. Information is educational only. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional before
                            making decisions based on content here.

                        <summary><strong>Q2: Do affiliate links influence reviews?</strong></summary>
                        <p>
                            No. Reviews are based on independent evaluation. Affiliate links help support site costs but
                            do not affect editorial judgment.

                            Major updates occur when significant new research or regulatory changes emerge. Minor corrections
                            may happen at any time.
