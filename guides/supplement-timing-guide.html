            <h1>The Ultimate Supplement Timing Guide: When to Take What</h1>
            <p class="review-meta">By Mark Smith | Last Updated: November 10, 2023</p>
            <p>You've bought the supplements, but are you taking them at the right time to maximize their effects? While total daily intake is most important, strategic timing can give you an extra edge. Here’s a simple guide.</p>

            <h2>Pre-Workout (30-60 Minutes Before Exercise)</h2>
            <p>This one is in the name. The goal is to get the active ingredients into your bloodstream by the time you start your workout.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Caffeine:</strong> For energy and focus.</li>
                <li><strong>Beta-Alanine:</strong> To buffer lactic acid and improve endurance.</li>
                <li><strong>Citrulline Malate:</strong> For increased blood flow (pump) and performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Intra-Workout (During Exercise)</h2>
            <p>For long or particularly intense training sessions (over 90 minutes), intra-workout supplements can help maintain performance.</p>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>BCAAs/EAAs:</strong> Can help reduce muscle breakdown and fatigue.</li>
                <li><strong>Electrolytes:</strong> To replenish minerals lost through sweat.</li>
                <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> (e.g., Dextrose) To provide a quick source of energy and maintain glycogen stores.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Post-Workout (Within 1-2 Hours After Exercise)</h2>
            <p>The infamous "anabolic window" isn't as short as we once thought, but consuming nutrients after a workout is crucial for recovery.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Whey Protein:</strong> A fast-digesting protein source to kick-start muscle repair and synthesis.</li>
                <li><strong>Creatine Monohydrate:</strong> A great time to take your daily dose, as muscles are primed for nutrient uptake.</li>
                <li><strong>High-Glycemic Carbs:</strong> To replenish muscle glycogen stores quickly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Any Time of Day</h2>
            <p>These supplements are effective as long as you take them consistently every day. Timing is not critical.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multivitamins:</strong> Take with a meal to improve absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.</li>
                <li><strong>Fish Oil (Omega-3s):</strong> Take with food to prevent "fish burps".</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamin D:</strong> Best taken with a meal containing fat.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Before Bed</h2>
            <p>Certain supplements are best taken before sleep to aid recovery and relaxation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Casein Protein:</strong> A slow-digesting protein that provides a steady stream of amino acids overnight.</li>
                <li><strong>Magnesium:</strong> Can improve sleep quality and aid in muscle relaxation.</li>
                <li><strong>ZMA (Zinc, Magnesium, Vitamin B6):</strong> A popular stack for recovery and hormonal support.</li>
            </ul>
